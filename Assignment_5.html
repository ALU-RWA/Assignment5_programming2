Welcome to assignment 5 :) <br>
What we are doing here is making our previous design more elegant and more easy to implement
in a way that will provide us clarity  and peace of mind. <br>

<h2>Question 1</h2>

Optimize it in the best way you can. Organize your design into packages<br>
Put appropriate access modifiers on your classes, attributes, and methods.<br>
Submit a pdf file,this question is worth 80% <br>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
Does java tolerate multiple inheritance (inheriting from many parent classes)? If yes why? If no, why? <br>
Can a class implement more than one interface?<br>
